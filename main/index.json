However, the role of circRNAs in breast cancer remains unclear. Here we systematically analyzed the circular RNAs in breast cancer based on their characteristic in sponging disease-specific miRNAs and identified hsa_circ_001783 as a top ranked circRNA in our computation and verified its high expression in both breast cancer cells and cancer tissue. A higher level of hsa_circ_001783 was significantly correlated with heavier tumor burden and poorer prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Knockdown of this circRNA remarkably inhibited the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Importantly, hsa_circ_001783 promoted progression of breast cancer cells via sponging miR-200c-3p. Taken together, hsa_circ_001783 may serve as a novel prognostic and therapeutic target for breast cancer.","tags":null,"title":"Circular RNA hsa_circ_001783 regulates breast cancer progression via sponging miR-200c-3p","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Here, we characterize the role of ORP2 in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by employing ORP2-knockout (KO) hepatoma cells (HuH7) generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The ORP2-KO and control HuH7 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing, analyses of Akt signaling, carbohydrate and TG metabolism, the extracellular acidification rate, and the lipidome, as well as to transmission electron microscopy. The loss of ORP2 resulted in a marked reduction of active phosphorylated Akt(Ser473) and its target Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta(Ser9), consistent with defective Akt signaling. ORP2 was found to form a physical complex with the key controllers of Akt activity, Cdc37, and Hsp90, and to co-localize with Cdc37 and active Akt(Ser473) at lamellipodial plasma membrane regions, in addition to the previously reported ER-LD localization. ORP2-KO reduced glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, mRNA-encoding glycolytic enzymes, and SREBP-1 target gene expression, and led to defective TG synthesis and storage. ORP2-KO did not reduce but rather increased ER-LD contacts under basal culture conditions and interfered with their expansion upon fatty acid loading. Together with our recently published work (Kentala et al. in FASEB J 32:1281-1295, 2018), this study identifies ORP2 as a new regulatory nexus of Akt signaling, cellular energy metabolism, actin cytoskeletal function, cell migration, and proliferation.","tags":["Actin Cytoskeleton/genetics/metabolism; Biological Transport/genetics; Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics; Cell Line; Cell Movement/genetics; Cell Proliferation/genetics; Chaperonins/genetics; Energy Metabolism/genetics; Gene Knockout Techniques; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Lipid Metabolism/genetics; Organelles/genetics/metabolism; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism; RNA","Messenger/genetics; Receptors","Steroid/genetics; Signal Transduction/genetics; Akt signaling; CRISPR-Cas9; Glycolysis; OSBP-related protein; OSBPL2; Triacylglycerol"],"title":"OSBP-related protein-2 (ORP2): a novel Akt effector that controls cellular energy metabolism","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536447600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536447600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://yz-lab.org/main/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/main/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["P.

We addressed ORP2 function in hepatocytes by generating ORP2-knockout (KO) HuH7 cells by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, followed by analyses of transcriptome, F-actin morphology, migration, adhesion, and proliferation. RNA sequencing of ORP2-KO cells revealed 2-fold changes in 579 mRNAs. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) uncovered alterations in the following functional categories: cellular movement, cell-cell signaling and interaction, cellular development, cellular function and maintenance, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell morphology. Many pathways in these categories involved actin cytoskeleton, cell migration, adhesion, or proliferation. Analysis of the ORP2 interactome uncovered 109 putative new partners. Their IPA analysis revealed Ras homolog A (RhoA) signaling as the most significant pathway. Interactions of ORP2 with SEPT9, MLC12, and ARHGAP12 were validated by independent assays. ORP2-KO resulted in abnormal F-actin morphology characterized by impaired capacity to form lamellipodia, migration defect, and impaired adhesion and proliferation. Rescue of the migration phenotype and generation of typical cell surface morphology required an intact ORP2 phosphoinositide binding site, suggesting that ORP2 function involves phosphoinositide binding and transport. The results point at a novel function of ORP2 as a lipid-sensing regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, with impacts on hepatocellular migration, adhesion, and proliferation.-Kentala, H., Koponen, A., Kivela, A.

These bacteria express a secreted lipoxygenase (PA-LOX), which oxygenates free arachidonic acid to 15S-hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid. It binds phospholipids at its active site and physically interacts with lipid vesicles. When incubated with red blood cells membrane lipids are oxidized and hemolysis is induced but the structures of the oxygenated membrane lipids have not been determined. Using a lipidomic approach, we analyzed the formation of oxidized phospholipids generated during the in vitro incubation of recombinant PA-LOX with human erythrocytes and cultured human lung epithelial cells. Precursor scanning of lipid extracts prepared from these cells followed by multiple reaction monitoring and MS/MS analysis revealed a complex mixture of oxidation products. For human red blood cells this mixture comprised forty different phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine species carrying oxidized fatty acid residues, such as hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids, hydroxy- and keto-eicosatetraenoic acid, hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid as well as oxygenated derivatives of less frequently occurring polyenoic fatty acids. Similar oxygenation products were also detected when cultured lung epithelial cells were employed but here the amounts of oxygenated lipids were smaller and under identical experimental conditions we did not detect major signs of cell lysis. However, live imaging indicated an impaired capacity for trypan blue exclusion and an augmented mitosis rate. Taken together these data indicate that PA-LOX can oxidize the membrane lipids of eukaryotic cells and that the functional consequences of this reaction strongly depend on the cell type.","tags":["Biomembranes; Eicosanoids; Fatty acids; Infectious diseases; Lipidomics; Oxidative stress; Phospholipids"],"title":"Specific oxygenation of plasma membrane phospholipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipoxygenase induces structural and functional alterations in mammalian cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" June 18, 2019: Wellcome Adrian Chau joining the lab.

It is strongly induced by insulin in vivo in WAT and in vitro in adipocytes. In this study we addressed the function of Angptl8 in adipocytes by its stable lentivirus-mediated knock-down in 3T3-L1 cells, followed by analyses of triglyceride (TG) storage, lipid droplet (LD) morphology, the cellular lipidome, lipolysis, and gene expression. Depletion of Angptl8 did not drastically affect the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells but resulted in a moderate (18-19%) reduction of stored TGs. The lipidome analysis revealed a reduction of alkyl- phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) plasmalogens, as well as saturated PCs and PEs. Importantly, the Angptl8 depleted cells displayed enhanced lipolysis as measured by release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Consistently, mRNAs encoding Angptl4 and Leptin, which facilitate lipolysis, as well as Cpt1a, Cpt1b, and Pgc-1alpha involved in FA oxidation, were elevated. The Angptl8 mRNA itself was suppressed by pharmacologic treatments inducing lipolysis: stimulation with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. To conclude, knock-down of Angptl8 in adipocytes suggests that the protein acts to inhibit intracellular lipolysis, analogous to its activity in the circulation. Depletion of Angptl8 results in an altered cellular phospholipid composition. The findings identify Angptl8 as a central insulin-regulated controller of adipocyte lipid metabolism.","tags":["Angptl8; Ether phospholipids; Lipid storage; Lipidome; Lipolysis; Plasmalogen; Triglyceride"],"title":"Angiopoietin-like 8 (Angptl8) controls adipocyte lipolysis and phospholipid composition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

Our findings provide the first report showing a complex leukodystrophy associated with POLR1A. Variants in three other RNA polymerase subunits, POLR1C, POLR3A and POLR3B, are known to cause recessive leukodystrophy similar to the disease afflicting the present family but with a later onset.

We investigate whether MS-based profiling of plasma improves noninvasive risk estimates of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared with routinely available clinical parameters and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) genotype at rs738409. METHODS: We used MS-based analytic platforms to measure levels of lipids and metabolites in blood samples from 318 subjects who underwent a liver biopsy because of suspected NASH. The subjects were divided randomly into estimation (n = 223) and validation (n = 95) groups to build and validate the model. Gibbs sampling and stepwise logistic regression, which fulfilled the Bayesian information criterion, were used for variable selection and modeling. RESULTS: Features of the metabolic syndrome and the variant in PNPLA3 encoding I148M were significantly more common among subjects with than without NASH. We developed a model to identify subjects with NASH based on clinical data and PNPLA3 genotype (NASH Clin Score), which included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype. This model identified subjects with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.778 (95% confidence interval, 0.709-0.846). We then used backward stepwise logistic regression analyses of variables from the NASH Clin Score and MS-based factors associated with NASH to develop the NASH ClinLipMet Score. This included glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoethanolamine 40:6, AST, and fasting insulin, along with PNPLA3 genotype. It identified patients with NASH with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.866 (95% confidence interval, 0.820-0.913). The NASH ClinLipMet score identified patients with NASH with significantly higher accuracy than the NASH Clin Score or MS-based profiling alone. CONCLUSIONS: A score based on MS (glutamate, isoleucine, glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine 16:0, phosphoethanolamine 40:6) and knowledge of AST, fasting insulin, and PNPLA3 genotype is significantly better than a score based on clinical or metabolic profiles alone in determining the risk of NASH.","tags":["Diagnosis; Liver; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Prediction; Triglycerides"],"title":"Noninvasive Detection of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Using Clinical Markers and Circulating Levels of Lipids and Metabolites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We determined which bioactive lipids co-segregate with IR in the human liver. METHODS: Liver lipidome was profiled in liver biopsies from 125 subjects that were divided into equally sized groups based on median HOMA-IR ('High and Low HOMA-IR', n=62 and n=63) or PNPLA3 genotype (PNPLA3(148MM/MI), n=61 vs. PNPLA3(148II), n=64). The subjects were also divided into 4 groups who had either IR, the I148M gene variant, both of the risk factors or neither. RESULTS: Steatosis and NASH prevalence were similarly increased in 'High HOMA-IR' and PNPLA3(148MM/MI) groups compared to their respective control groups. The 'High HOMA-IR' but not the PNPLA3(148MM/MI) group had features of IR. The liver in 'High HOMA-IR' vs. 'Low HOMA-IR' was markedly enriched in saturated and monounsaturated triacylglycerols and free fatty acids, dihydroceramides (markers of de novo ceramide synthesis) and ceramides. Markers of other ceramide synthetic pathways were unchanged. In PNPLA3(148MM/MI)vs. PNPLA3(148II), the increase in liver fat was due to polyunsaturated triacylglycerols while other lipids were unchanged. Similar changes were observed when data were analyzed using the 4 subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Similar increases in liver fat and NASH are associated with a metabolically harmful saturated, ceramide-enriched liver lipidome in 'Metabolic NAFLD' but not in 'PNPLA3 NAFLD'. This difference may explain why metabolic but not PNPLA3 NAFLD increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.","tags":["Ceramides; Dihydroceramides; Free fatty acids; Insulin resistance; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; PNPLA3; Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein 3"],"title":"Hepatic ceramides dissociate steatosis and insulin resistance in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

In morbidly obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery preceded by a very low calorie diet, miR-192* in VAT correlated negatively (r=-0.387; p=0.046) with serum triglyceride (TG) and positively with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration (r=0.396; p=0.041). In a less obese patient cohort, the miRNA correlated negatively with the body mass index (r=-0.537; p=0.026). To characterize the function of miR-192*, we overexpressed it in cultured adipocytes and analyzed the expression of adipogenic differentiation markers as well as cellular TG content. Reduced TG and expression of the adipocyte marker proteins aP2 (adipocyte protein 2) and perilipin 1 were observed. The function of miR-192* was further investigated by transcriptomic profiling of adipocytes expressing this miRNA, revealing impacts on key lipogenic genes. A number of the mRNA alterations were validated by qPCR. Western analysis confirmed a marked reduction of the lipogenic enzyme SCD (stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase-1), the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2) and the high-density lipoprotein receptor SCARB1 (scavenger receptor B, type I).

Subjects with the highest (median liver fat 30%, n = 15) and lowest (0%, n = 15) liver fat content were selected from 100 obese patients for miRNA profiling of liver biopsies on microarrays carrying probes for 1438 human miRNAs (a cross-sectional study). Target mRNAs and pathways were predicted for the miRNAs most significantly upregulated in NAFLD, their cell-type-specific expression was investigated by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the transcriptome of immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) transfected with the miRNA with the highest number of predicted targets, miR-576-5p, was studied. The screen revealed 42 miRNAs up- and two downregulated in the NAFLD as compared to non-NAFLD liver. The miRNAs differing most significantly between the groups, miR-103a-2*, miR-106b, miR-576-5p, miRPlus-I137*, miR-892a, miR-1282, miR-3663-5p, and miR-3924, were all upregulated in NAFLD liver. Target pathways predicted for these miRNAs included ones involved in cancer, metabolic regulation, insulin signaling, and inflammation. Consistent transcriptome changes were observed in IHH transfected with miR-576-5p, and western analysis revealed a marked reduction of the RAC1 protein belonging to several miR-576-5p target pathways. To conclude, we identified 44 miRNAs differentially expressed in NAFLD versus non-NAFLD liver, 42 of these being novel in the context of NAFLD. The study demonstrates that by applying a novel study set-up and a broad-coverage array platform one can reveal a wealth of previously undiscovered miRNA dysregulation in metabolic disease.","tags":["Adult; Cell Line","Transformed; Cells","Cultured; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatocytes/metabolism/pathology; Humans; Liver/metabolism/pathology/surgery; Male; MicroRNAs/biosynthesis; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/metabolism/pathology/surgery; Up-Regulation/physiology; Hepatocyte; immortalized human hepatocytes; liver biopsy; microRNA; microarray; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease"],"title":"Novel hepatic microRNAs upregulated in human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

METHODS: We genotyped 300 Finnish subjects for the E167K (rs58542926) variant in TM6SF2 and for the I148M (rs738409) variant in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) in whom LFAT was measured using (1)H-MRS and circulating lipids by UPLC-MS. We compared the plasma lipidome between E167K carriers (TM6SF2(EK/KK)) and non-carriers (TM6SF2(EE)), and between three groups of NAFLD: (i) carriers of the E167K but not of the I148M variant in PNPLA3 ('TM6SF2 NAFLD'), (ii) carriers of the I148M but not of the E167K variant ('PNPLA3 NAFLD'), and (iii) non-carriers of either risk allele ('Non-risk NAFLD'). Hepatic and adipose tissue insulin sensitivities were measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique combined with infusion of [3-(3)H]glucose in 111 subjects. RESULTS: The LFAT content was 34% higher in the TM6SF2(EK/KK) (13.07+/-1.57%) than in the TM6SF2(EE) group (9.77+/-0.58%, p=0.013). The effect of insulin on glucose production and lipolysis were significantly higher in the TM6SF2(EK/KK) than in the TM6SF2(EE) group. Comparison of the three NAFLD groups with similar LFATs showed that both the 'TM6SF2 NAFLD' and 'PNPLA3 NAFLD' had significantly lower triglyceride levels and were characterized by lower levels of most common TAGs compared to the 'Non-risk NAFLD' group. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the E167K variant in TM6SF2 is associated with a distinct subtype of NAFLD, characterized by preserved insulin sensitivity with regard to lipolysis, hepatic glucose production and lack of hypertriglyceridemia despite a clearly increased LFAT content.","tags":["Glucose production; Lipolysis; Liver; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Mass spectrometry"],"title":"Circulating triacylglycerol signatures and insulin sensitivity in NAFLD associated with the E167K variant in TM6SF2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

Overexpression of Cripto-1 has been found to be correlated with tumorigenesis and may affect tumor recurrence and metastasis. The previous studies indicate that Cripto-1 might be a potential prognostic biomarker for several malignancies. The aim of this study is to examine Cripto-1 expression pattern and clinicopathological significance in human bladder cancer patients. We investigated Cripto-1 expression in 30 paired bladder cancer tissues and corresponding noncancerous bladder tissues using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, Cripto-1 expression in 130 bladder cancer specimens and bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays. The recurrence/metastasis-free survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was also used for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors. The results showed that Cripto-1 expression is increased in bladder cancer tissues and is significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.005) and tumor grade (P = 0.035). In addition, the expression level of Cripto-1 in bladder cancer was also found to be significantly associated with SRY-related HMG-box gene 2 expression (P = 0.003) and Ki-67 (P = 0.001). Compared with the patients with low Cripto-1 expression, the patients with high Cripto-1 expression had significantly poorer recurrence/metastasis-free survival (P = 0.011). Cox regression showed that Cripto-1 might be an independent prognostic factor for recurrence/metastasis-free survival (P = 0.036). Our findings suggest that high Cripto-1 expression might be involved in the development of bladder cancer and a potentially effective prognostic marker in bladder cancer patients.","tags":["Adult; Aged; Aged","80 and over; Disease-Free Survival; Female; GPI-Linked Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Gene Expression Regulation","Neoplastic; Humans; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics; Neoplasm Recurrence","Local/genetics/pathology; Prognosis; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics/pathology"],"title":"Cripto-1 expression and its prognostic value in human bladder cancer patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

A novel FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract)-like motif was identified in ORP3; only disruption of both the FFAT-like and canonical FFAT motif abolished the phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulated interaction of ORP3-P with VAPA. Co-expression of ORP3 and VAPA induced R-Ras activation, dependent on the interactions of ORP3 with VAPA and the PM. Consistently, downstream AktS473 phosphorylation and beta1-integrin activity were enhanced by ORP3-VAPA. To conclude, phosphorylation of ORP3 controls its association with VAPA.

METHODS: Clinical characteristics, PNPLA3 genotype at rs738409, and serum cytokeratin 18 fragments were measured in 296 consecutive bariatric surgery patients who underwent a liver biopsy to discover and validate a NASH score ('NASH score'). We also defined the cut-off for NASH for a previously validated NAFLD liver fat score to diagnose NASH in the same cohort ('NASH liver fat score'). Both scores were validated in an Italian cohort comprising of 380, mainly non-bariatric surgery patients, who had undergone a liver biopsy for NASH.

The mechanisms of ORP function have remained incompletely understood. However, several ORPs are present at membrane contact sites and act as either lipid transporters or sensors that control lipid metabolism, cell signaling, and vesicle transport. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, has gained increasing popularity as a model organism in developmental biology, human disease, toxicology, and drug discovery. However, LTPs in the fish are thus far unexplored. In this article we report a series of bioinformatic analyses showing that the OSBPL gene family is highly conserved between the fish and human. The OSBPL subfamily structure is markedly similar between the two organisms, and all 12 human genes have orthologs, designated osbpl and located on 11 chromosomes in D. rerio. Interestingly, osbpl2 and osbpl3 are present as two closely related homologs (a and b), due to gene duplication events in the teleost lineage. Moreover, the domain structures of the distinct ORP proteins are almost identical between zebrafish and man, and molecular modeling in the present study suggests that ORD liganding by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) is a feature conserved between yeast Osh3p, human ORP3, and zebrafish Osbpl3. The present analysis identifies D. rerio as an attractive model to study the functions of ORPs in vertebrate development and metabolism.","tags":["Gene conservation; Lipid-binding protein; ORP; Osbpl; Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate; Zebrafish"],"title":"A vertebrate model for the study of lipid binding/transfer protein function: conservation of OSBP-related proteins between zebrafish and human","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Here, a yeast two-hybrid screen identified Homo sapiens sperm associated antigen 5 (SPAG5)/Astrin as interaction partner of ORP8. The putative interaction was further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. ORP8 did not colocalize with kinetochore-associated SPAG5 in mitotic HepG2 or HuH7 cells, but overexpressed ORP8 was capable of recruiting SPAG5 onto endoplasmic reticulum membranes in interphase cells. In our experiments, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) retarded the HepG2 cell cycle, causing accumulation in G2/M phase; ORP8 overexpression resulted in the same phenotype. Importantly, ORP8 knock-down dramatically inhibited the oxysterol effect on HepG2 cell cycle, suggesting a mediating role of ORP8. Furthermore, knock-down of SPAG5 significantly reduced the effects of both ORP8 overexpression and 25OHC on the cell cycle, placing SPAG5 downstream of the two cell-cycle interfering factors. Taken together, the present results suggest that ORP8 may via SPAG5 mediate oxysterol interference of the HepG2 cell cycle.","tags":["Blotting","Western; Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology; Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Hydroxycholesterols/pharmacology; Immunoprecipitation; Microscopy","Fluorescence; Receptors","Steroid/metabolism; Subcellular Fractions; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; 25-Hydroxycholesterol; Astrin; Cell cycle; ORP8; Oxysterol-binding protein; SPAG5"],"title":"OSBP-related protein 8 (ORP8) interacts with Homo sapiens sperm associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) and mediates oxysterol interference of HepG2 cell cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

PNPLA3(I148M) induced a net accumulation of unlabeled TAGs, but not newly synthesized total [(13)C]TAGs.

PNPLA3(WT) associated in PCA with newly synthesized [(13)C]TAGs, particularly 52:1 and 50:1, while PNPLA3(I148M) associated with similar preexisting TAGs. PNPLA3(WT) overexpression resulted in increased [D17]oleic acid labeling of TAGs during 24 h, and after longer incubations their turnover was accelerated, effects not detected with PNPLA3(I148M). PNPLA3(I148M) localized more extensively to lipid droplets (LDs) than PNPLA3(WT), suggesting that the substitution alters distribution of PNPLA3 between LDs and endoplasmic reticulum/cytosol. This study reveals a function of PNPLA3 in FA-selective TAG remodeling, resulting in increased TAG saturation. A defect in TAG remodeling activity likely contributes to the TAG accumulation observed in cells expressing PNPLA3(I148M).","tags":["adiponutrin; lipase; lipid droplet; lipidomics; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3"],"title":"PNPLA3 mediates hepatocyte triacylglycerol remodeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

METHODS: We searched for studies in any language recorded in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library before August 2013. The associations under allele contrast model, codominant model, dominant model, and recessive model were analyzed. The strengths of the association between IL-10 polymorphisms and IBS risk were estimated using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Fixed effects model was used to pool the result if the test of heterogeneity was not significant, otherwise the random-effect model was selected. RESULTS: Eight case-control studies analyzing three single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1800870 (-1082 A/G), rs1800871 (-819C/T), and rs1800872 (-592A/C) of the IL-10 gene, which involved 928 cases and 1363 controls, were eligible for our analysis. The results showed that rs1800870 polymorphisms were associated with a decreased risk of IBS (GG+GA vs AA: OR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.66-0.96), (AA+GA vs GG: OR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.52-0.90). Subgroup analysis revealed such association only existed in Caucasian ethnicity (AA+GA vs GG, OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.55-0.89).

To derive a more precise estimation, we performed a meta-analysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible case-control studies. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. The overall association was significant (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11-1.48, P = 0.001). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed GSTM1 null genotype significantly associated with PCa risk among Asians (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.78, P = 0.03) but not among Caucasians (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.96-1.31, P = 0.16). In addition, we did not find that smoking modified the genotype effect on the risk of PCa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present meta-analysis suggested that GSTM1 null allele was a low-penetrant risk factor for PCa among Asians.","tags":["Alleles; Asian Continental Ancestry Group/genetics; Case-Control Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group/genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glutathione Transferase/genetics; Humans; Male; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism","Genetic; Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics; Smoking/genetics"],"title":"Association of GSTM1 null allele with prostate cancer risk: evidence from 36 case-control studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

We analyzed here the quantity of ORP mRNAs in human subcutaneous (s.c.) and visceral adipose depots, as well as in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocyte cell model. All of the ORP mRNAs were present in the s.c and visceral adipose tissues, and the two depots shared an almost identical ORP mRNA expression pattern. SGBS adipocytes displayed a similar pattern, suggesting that the adipose tissue ORP expression pattern mainly derives from adipocytes. During SGBS cell adipogenic differentiation, ORP2, ORP3, ORP4, ORP7, and ORP8 mRNAs were down-regulated, while ORP11 was induced. To assess the impacts of ORPs on adipocyte differentiation, ORP3 and ORP8, proteins down-regulated during adipogenesis, were overexpressed in differentiating SGBS adipocytes, while ORP11, a protein induced during adipogenesis, was silenced. ORP8 overexpression resulted in reduced expression of the aP2 mRNA, while down-regulation of adiponectin and aP2 was observed in ORP11 silenced cells. Furthermore, ORP8 overexpression or silencing of ORP11 markedly decreased cellular triglyceride storage. These data identify the patterns of ORP expression in human adipose depots and SGBS adipocytes, and provide the first evidence for a functional impact of ORPs on the adipocyte phenotype.","tags":null,"title":"OSBP-Related Proteins (ORPs) in Human Adipose Depots and Cultured Adipocytes: Evidence for Impacts on the Adipocyte Phenotype","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

METHODS: Eligible studies published up to May 2011 were retrieved via both computer searches and manual review of references. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risk estimates (SRRE) based on high-contrast to low-intake values. Sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted, and heterogeneity among study results was explored through stratified analyses by study design, gender, geographic region, year of publication, or whether or not adjustment for several confounders (ie, age, gender, body mass index, smoking, and total energy intake). RESULTS: We extracted data from 14 studies on milk (involving 4879 cases) and 6 studies on dairy products (3087 cases). The total study population was up to 324,241 individuals. Overall, there was no significant association between milk intake and bladder cancer (SRRE 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.02). However, an inverse association was found in the United States (SRRE 0.88, 95% CI .79-.99). In addition, no significant association was observed between consumption of dairy products and risk of bladder cancer (SRRE 0.95, 95% CI .71-1.27), though an inverse association was detected in the Japanese population (SRRE 0.56, 95% CI .40-.80). CONCLUSION: There appears to be enough evidence to support the null hypothesis. The overall result was not statistically significant. The findings of this meta-analysis are not supportive of an independent relationship between the intake of milk or dairy products and the risk of bladder cancer. However, these findings are based on limited research. Further efforts should be made to confirm these findings.","tags":["Animals; Cattle; Dairy Products; Diet; Female; Humans; Male; Milk; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology"],"title":"Milk and dairy consumption and risk of bladder cancer: a meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

In this study, we identified by yeast two-hybrid screening an interaction partner of ORP7, GATE-16, which (i) regulates Golgi SNARE of 28kDa (GS28) function and stability, and (ii) plays a role in autophagosome biogenesis. The interaction was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in living cells. The interacting regions were delineated within aa 1-142 of ORP7 and aa 30-117 of GATE-16. ORP7 knock-down in 293A cells resulted in a 40% increase of GS28 protein while ORP7 overexpression had the opposite effect (25% decrease of GS28). We show evidence that the regulation of GS28 by ORP7 does not occur at the level of transcription, but involves degradation of GS28 on proteasomes. Truncated ORP7 that lacks the GATE-16 binding region failed to affect GS28 stability, evidencing for specificity of the observed effect. Similar to ORP7 overexpression, treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) resulted in GS28 destabilization, which was potentiated by excess ORP7 and inhibited by ORP7 silencing. Overexpression of ORP7 led in most cells to formation of vacuolar structures positive for RFP-LC3, thus representing autophagic elements. Also GATE-16 was found in the vacuolar ORP7-positive elements, suggesting that excess ORP7 increases entrapment of GATE-16 in autophagosomes. Taken together, our results suggest that ORP7 negatively regulates GS28 protein stability via sequestration of GATE-16, and may mediate the effect of 25-OH on GS28 and Golgi function.","tags":null,"title":"OSBP-related protein 7 interacts with GATE-16 and negatively regulates GS28 protein stability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

ORP11 is present at highest levels in human ovary, testis, kidney, liver, stomach, brain, and adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates abundant ORP11 in the epithelial cells of kidney tubules, testicular tubules, caecum, and skin. ORP11 in HEK293 cells resides on Golgi complex and LE, co-localizing with GFP-Rab9, TGN46, GFP-Rab7, and a fluorescent medial-trans-Golgi marker. Under electron microscopic observation, cells overexpressing ORP11 displayed lamellar lipid bodies associated with vacuolar structures or the Golgi complex, indicating a disturbance of lipid trafficking. N-terminal fragment of ORP11 (aa 1-292) localized partially to Golgi, but displayed enhanced localization on Rab7- and Rab9-positive LE, while the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (aa 273-747) was cytosolic, demonstrating that the membrane targeting determinants are N-terminal. Yeast two-hybrid screen revealed interaction of ORP11 with the related ORP9. The interacting region was delineated within aa 98-372 of ORP9 and aa 154-292 of ORP11. Overexpressed ORP9 was able to recruit EGFP-ORP11 to membranes, and ORP9 silencing inhibited ORP11 Golgi association. The results identify ORP11 as an OSBP homologue distributing at the Golgi-LE interface and define the ORP9-ORP11 dimer as a functional unit that may act as an intracellular lipid sensor or transporter.","tags":["Binding Sites; Blotting","Western; Cell Line; Endosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure; Gene Silencing; Golgi Apparatus/metabolism/ultrastructure; Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lipids/chemistry; Organ Specificity; Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Multimerization; Protein Structure","Tertiary; Protein Transport; Receptors","Steroid/chemistry/metabolism; Subcellular Fractions/metabolism; Vacuoles/metabolism/ultrastructure"],"title":"OSBP-related protein 11 (ORP11) dimerizes with ORP9 and localizes at the Golgi-late endosome interface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vesa M.
